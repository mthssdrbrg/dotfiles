# dotfiles

A collection of various dotfiles ranging from environment variables to window
management. Currently using them on Mac OSX, so some things are specific while
others should work on Linux. Windows is a no-go.

I currently manage them using `rcm`, created by thoughtbot and available over
[here](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm), and for a quick guide go [here](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos).
